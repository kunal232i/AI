# Family Tree Prolog Program

## Getting Started

To run the Family Tree Prolog program, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the AI/prolog website.

2. Execute the installation commands provided on the website in your terminal.

3. After completing the installation, type `swipl` in the terminal to launch the Prolog interpreter.

4. To compile the code, type `[name of file].` in the Prolog interpreter, replacing `[name of file]` with the actual name of the Prolog file containing the family tree code.

## Output

Once you have compiled the code, you can interact with the Family Tree program to explore and query the relationships in the family tree. The specific output will depend on the queries you make.
