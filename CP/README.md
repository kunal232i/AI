# Snake Game with Automatic Food Generation

Welcome to the Snake Game with Automatic Food Generation! This Java-based game allows you to control a snake and eat randomly generated food. As you progress, the snake grows longer, and your goal is to keep the snake from running into itself or the game boundaries.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Locate the `snakegame` class in the `CP` package (`CP/snakegame.java`).

4. Run the `snakegame` class to start the Snake Game.

5. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.

6. Eat the food (represented by a red square) that appears randomly on the screen to grow longer.

7. The game will end if the snake runs into itself or the game boundaries.

8. The snake will automatically change its direction based on the proximity to the food, making it more challenging to control.

9. Have fun playing the Snake Game and see how long you can make the snake!
