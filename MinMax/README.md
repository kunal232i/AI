# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI and Non-AI Methods

This repository contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Java, offering both an AI-based method and a non-AI method for playing against the computer. Below, you'll find instructions for getting started with each method.

## AI Method

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project folder in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Navigate to the `TicTacToe` class in the `MinMax` package (`MinMax/TicTacToe.java`).

4. Run the `TicTacToe` class to start the AI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

5. Select 'X' or 'O' as your desired player (the AI will play with the opposite symbol).

6. Play the game according to the instructions provided in the console.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves and provide a challenging opponent. Have fun trying to beat the AI!

## Non-AI Method

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project folder in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Navigate to the `TicTacToeNonAI` class in the `MinMax` package (`MinMax/TicTacToeNonAI.java`).

4. Run the `TicTacToeNonAI` class to start the non-AI based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

5. The game will prompt you to choose 'X' or 'O' as your symbol.

6. Play the game by entering the row and column indices (0-2) where you want to place your symbol.

7. Alternate turns with the computer to play the game until there is a winner or the board is full.

The non-AI method allows you to play against the computer, which follows a simple heuristic strategy for its moves. Enjoy the challenge of competing against the computer in this classic game!
